   *
   * When the user types in the textbook and either clicks "Search" button or hits the enter key,
   * display the message "No results for ___ found" inside of this <p></p> below.
   * For example, if the user searches for "Indian Ocean", display "No results for Indian Ocean found".

   * display the "No results for ___ found" message every time.)
